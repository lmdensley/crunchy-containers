databasesize,the size in Megabytes of a database,per database
xact_commit, Number of transactions in this database that have been committed , per database
xact_rollback, Number of transactions in this database that have been rolled back, per database
blks_read, Number of disk blocks read in this database, per database
blks_hit,Number of times disk blocks were found already in the buffer cache, so that a read was not necessary (this only includes hits in the PostgreSQL buffer cache, not the operating system's file system cache), per database

== Locks Being Waited Upon by Queries

This metric shows locks being waited upon by queries.  Queries
waiting on locaks for any extended period shows a problem like
heavy lock contention.

== Replication Delay

This metric shows the amount of bytes the replication delay is behind master per each slave. If the slave and the master are in synchronous state, the replication delay is zero.

== Transaction Rate

Shows the rate of transactions executed per second since the last call of this function. 

== Time Since Last Vacuum per Table 

This metric shows the amount of time passed in seconds since the last vacuum was run per table in your database

== Oldest Transaction

This metric shows the time the longest running transaction has been open in 
your database.
