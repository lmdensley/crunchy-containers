== Description
The crunchy-postgres container executes the Postgres database.  


=== Packages

The container image is built using either the Crunchy Postgres release
or the community version based upon a flag in the Makefile.

The Crunchy postgres RPMs are available to Crunchy customers only.  The
Crunchy release is meant for customers that require enterprise level
support.

The PGDG community RPMs can be used as well by simply commenting out
the Crunchy yum repo within the Dockerfiles and uncommenting
the PGDG yum repo.

=== setup.sql

The setup.sql script is used to define startup SQL commands that are
executed when the database is first created.

=== Environment Variables
 
 * PG_MODE - either master or slave, this value determines whether
   the database is set up as a master or slave instance
 * PG_MASTER_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as 
   master.  The *master* user has super user priviledges.
 * PG_MASTER_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_MASTER_USER database user
 * PG_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as a normal user.
   This user is created as part of the setup.sql script upon database
   creation and allows users to predefine an application user.
 * PG_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_USER database user that is created
 * PG_DATABASE - a database that is created upon database initialization
 * PG_ROOT_PASSWORD - the postgres user password set up upon database
   initialization

The following features are supported by the crunchy-postgres container:

 * use of openshift secrets
 * ability to restore from a database backup
 * use of custom pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf files
