one scheme that worked....

add allowPrivilegedContainer: true
to the security context for the restricted and priviledged users....

add RunAsAny
to the security context to allow us to run as the postgres user

in the container, I used USER root, and then was able to chmod/chown
the emptyDir volume to the postgres user...

oc oc config use-context default/192-168-0-107:8443/system:admin
oc edit scc restricted --config=/var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.config/master/admin.kubeconfig
oc edit scc privileged
