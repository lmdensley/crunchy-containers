== Description

The crunchy-backup container executes a pg_basebackup against another
database container.  The backup is a full backup using the standard
utility included with postgres, pg_basebackup.

=== Backup Location

Backups are stored in a mounted backup volume location, using the
database host name as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique
backup directory based upon a date/timestamp.  It is left to the
user to perform database backup archives in this current version
of the container.  This backup location is referenced when performing
a database restore.

=== Dependencies

The container is meant to be using a NFS or similar network file system
to persist database backups.

=== Example

Examples of using the container are found in the standalone and openshift
documents.
