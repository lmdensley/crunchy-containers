== Description
The crunchy-pgpool container executes the pgpool utility.  Pgpool can
be used to provide a smart postgres-aware proxy to a postgres cluster,

with a single database connection.

Postgres slaves are read-only whereas a master is both read and write
capable.

=== Environment Variables
 
 * PG_USERNAME - user to connect to postgres
 * PG_PASSWORD - user password to connect to postgres
 * PG_MASTER_SERVICE_NAME - database host to connect to for the master node
 * PG_SLAVE_SERVICE_NAME - database host to connect to for the slave node
